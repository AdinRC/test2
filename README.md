## üßÆ Calculation Logic

- **DSR Used**:
  - Net income < RM 3,000: DSR = 60%
  - Net income < RM 5,000: DSR = 70%
  - Net income < RM 7,000: DSR = 75%
  - Otherwise: DSR = 80%

- **Max Instalment**:
  ```
  Max Instalment = (Net Income √ó DSR) - Komitmen
  ```

- **Max Loan**:
  ```
  Max Loan = Max Instalment √ó [(1 + r)^n - 1] / [r √ó (1 + r)^n]
  where:
    r = monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
    n = total number of payments (years √ó 12)
  ```
